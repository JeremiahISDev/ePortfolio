				{`Imagine life where no one persevered. Life would be a monstrosity of failures. Fortunately, this was not the case for Helen Keller. This is shown in a play, The Miracle Worker, written by William Gibson. Helen Keller is a young girl who became blind and deaf after a fever at eighteen months. Her governess and teacher, Annie Sulivan, is guiding her to the light at the end of the tunnel. Both Helen and Annie persevere not only with each other but in their own lives. As The Miracle Worker develops, perseverance is a trait that is shown throughout all the acts. \n
In Act I, perseverance as aforestated is self-evident in both Annie and Helen. One example is when Annie “never finishes, because HELEN swings the doll with a furious energy, it hits Annie square in the face” (Gibson 270). This shows how Helen is persevering to remove Annie from her life as she does not want to be taught. Helen also wants to stay the way she knows how to live based on what she already knows. Another example is when Annie asks “You think I’m so easily gotten rid of?” (274) to Helen after she throws the key down the well. This shows how Annie will not give up on trying to teach Helen. As a result, perseverance is shown in Act I. \n
To continue, Act II brings a new perspective that Helen has towards learning something new and aborting her old ways. This is shown when Helen is attempting to sew on a sewing card, and as she does it, Annie encourages, “Bad Girl[,] Good Girl[,] Very Good Girl.” (277). This shows that as Helen wants to learn, Annie will subsequently assist her in that goal. Another example is when “ANNIE with HELEN’S hand takes up another spoonful, and shoves it into her open mouth.” (286). This excerpt is when Annie is attempting to teach Helen manners. Helen refuses to follow her directions which is ironic to her changed opinion towards learning. This is how perseverance is shown in Act II. \n
Finally, in Act III perseverance is also clear. One example of this is when Annie requests “Another week.” in the garden house (305). This is because Annie knows that her work is incomplete as Helen, at this point, is only knowledgeable of manners. Annie wants to continue to the extent where Helen learns and understands language. This continues after the extra week is rejected and Annie takes Helen to the water pump. Where “HELEN grabs the handle, pumps for more water, plunges her hand into its spurt and grabs ANNIE’S hand  to spell it again.” (314). This is the point in which Helen reaches the aforementioned hoped for extent, where she finally understands language. That is how perseverance is shown in Act III. \n
As aforementioned, perseverance is self-evident throughout The Miracle Worker by the characters’ actions. This is why perseverance is a trait we all need in our lives, and why WIlliam Gibson had to include this trait in his piece. So whenever struggle knocks, do not forget to persevere!`}
