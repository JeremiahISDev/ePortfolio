				{`GoGuardian is a teaching, suicide prevention, depression detection, and web filtering tool. GoGuardian Teacher provides classroom management and computer monitoring software, while GoGuardian Admin is a web filtering tool, providing filtering, app tracking, and history tracking. This works by the teacher initiating a session followed by forced joining from each one of the student’s monitors. Then the teacher sees all of the student’s screens in one grid view. By clicking on each screen they get a more detailed view of that computer’s tabs, screen, apps, and system info, such as CPU and GPU usage. Although some may think that GoGuardian is an assistive teaching tool, it simply is not; it has way too many permissions, it will work on any device including personal computers, and it allows schools to access each student's personal information even after school hours. \n To begin, GoGuardian has too many permissions. The GoGuardian software can read and change all your data on all websites, detect your physical location, read and change your browsing history, display notifications, know your email address, manage your apps, extensions, and themes, communicate with cooperating native applications, and see device information, such as its serial number or asset ID (Extension Manager). While some may say that these are needed for it to function properly, it does not. All it really needs is to display notifications and manage only itself, not all extensions. This goes to say that the school and GoGuardian want this extra unneeded information to “Remove some of the most basic software from a computer…and access to 70% of sites” (“Should GoGuardian Be Banned?”). As a result, the permissions are overwhelming not only to the student, but also the computer. \n To continue, GoGuardian takes full control of any device that a school account is logged into, even the other profiles, and virtual desktops. This is not reasonable because if a parent shares a device with a student, then shopping sites and banks will not only be clocked for the student but also the parent on their profile, account, or virtual desk. Once a school account is logged onto a device, GoGuardian is installed automatically on all accounts, profiles, and Virtual Desks, runs in the background at all times, and starts on system startup. It will also rummage through all personal files. According to GoGuardian themselves, “Any device, anywhere. Seamlessly integrate multiple device types and platforms…From Chromebooks and Apple devices to Windows and BYOD, GoGuardian’s suite of tools can help keep your users safe on any device.” (GoGuardian). BYOD refers to a personal device, thus this applies to not only managed devices, but also personal devices. Some administrators disagree and state that it is for safety purposes only. This can be true, but in very few cases. The majority of the time it will not help promote safety, because it will block banks on parents accounts, thus not allowing parents to pay bills and so forth. This is supported by Debate.org as it states “GoGuardian is SPYWARE”. Spyware is most commonly defined as software that is a virus and installs itself throughout the whole device, including the OS. Thus, GoGuardian has access to each device to an extreme extent. \n Finally, the GoGuardian Suite allows schools to access students’ personal information and collects that information. Liminex Inc. , known as GoGuardian in the educational field, claims to comply with the “Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)” (GoGaurdian) which is “no longer in effect as of 9 December 2019” (Federal Trade Commission). The “COPPA” implies that all information taken, requested or tracked be used in a passive way, only under the consent of the application's operators rather than the parents of children 13 and under. As GoGaurdian claims to comply with “COPPA,” it also defines Personal Information as “individually identifiable information about an individual collected online, including: A first and last name; A home or other physical address including street name and name of a city or town; Online contact information; A screen or user name where it functions in the same manner as online contact information, as defined in this section; A telephone number; A Social Security number; A persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different Web sites or online services. Such persistent identifier includes, but is not limited to, a customer number held in a cookie, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a processor or device serial number, or unique device identifier; A photograph, video, or audio file where such file contains a child's image or voice; Geolocation information sufficient to identify street name and name of a city or town; or Information concerning the child or the parents of that child that the operator collects online from the child and combines with an identifier described in this definition.”(Federal Trade Commission via Electronic Code of Federal Regulations). Because GoGuardian states to abide by “COPPA,” it does collect what is defined as Personal Information as aforementioned. Some administrators may despise the aforestated claim, stating that it is only a way for the average non-tech savvy teacher to keep an eye on the students. However, this is not the case as the majority of teachers use it as a way of spying and taking pride in their ability to control a full classroom from one computer without getting off their chair. In conclusion, GoGuardian is just a pure Personal Information sucking vacuum, and has no place in a school environment. \n As aforementioned, GoGuardian is a teaching tool that has no place in the education environment. It gives schools access to students' personal information both during and after school hours, it will work on any device including personal computers, and has so many permissions even though some may say that it is assistive. Unquestionably, schools using GoGuardian will ultimately suffer by invading students' privacy at an extreme measure.`}
